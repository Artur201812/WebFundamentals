Intersection Observer is one of these APIs that's probably universally loved, and, now that [Safari
has it](https://webkit.org/blog/8582/intersectionobserver-in-webkit/), also almost universally
supported. For a quick refresher, I recommend watching
[Surma](../../../resources/contributors/surma)'s
[Supercharged Microtip](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kW_atFXMG98) on Intersection Observer,
embedded below for your viewing pleasure, or reading his
[article](../../2016/04/intersectionobserver).

As a quick reminder, this is what the API looks like in the most basic case:

```javascript
const onIntersection = (entries) => {
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      console.log(entry);
    }
  });
};

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(onIntersection);
observer.observe(document.querySelector('#some-target'));
```
